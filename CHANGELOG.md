## Breaking Changes

### Input System (Latest)
- Changed input event structure to include both KEYDOWN and KEYUP

- Updated SimpleRenderer to handle input forwarding

### ECS Architecture
- Changed component access to use string-based lookup
- Modified system registration to require event system
- Updated entity creation to use explicit component addition

## Migration Guide

### Updating Input Handling
```python
# Old approach - direct pygame handling
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        # Handle input directly

# New approach - unified input pipeline
engine.renderer.set_engine_events(engine.events)
input_system = InputSystem(event_system=engine.events)
engine.ecs.add_system(input_system)
```

### ECS System Registration
```python
# Old approach - standalone systems
movement_system = MovementSystem()

# New approach - event-connected systems
movement_system = MovementSystem(event_system=engine.events)
engine.ecs.add_system(movement_system)
```
