# simplex-engine

Simplex Engine is a modern game engine written in Python.
We believe hardware performance will continue to improve in the future.
This project aims to deliver the best experience to our customers:
- Game players
- Game developers
- Video creators
...

We believe a simplified engine (less code complexity, more functionality) will make game and video development faster, easier, and better.

## Architecture

- Uses ECS (Entity-Component-System) as the developer interface
- Uses puopengl for rendering and video creation
- Uses pybullet for the physics system
- Uses Python for scripting and logic

### Advantages

By using Python for all subsystems, this engine provides dynamic behavior when building game or video systems.
For example, when you write a command, you immediately see the result on your monitor. Once you confirm it works as intended, you can build for better performance.

Python offers a superior development interface, making development and debugging easier and faster.
