# Architecture Review & Recommendations (Post-MVP-2)

## Current Architecture Overview

- **Subsystems:** Modular design with clear separation: Audio, Renderer, ResourceManager, Input, Scripting, EventSystem.
- **Event-Driven:** Unified event system for decoupled communication between subsystems.
- **Resource Management:** Caching and reference counting implemented; integration with audio and demo scenes.
- **Renderer:** Scene graph and advanced primitives scaffolded; basic material support.
- **Input:** Abstract backend, pygame support, event emission, backend swap documented.
- **Scripting:** Hot-reloading and dynamic updates supported.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for all major subsystems, file-independent.
- **Documentation:** Architecture, config, and event types documented; onboarding and demo scenes provided.

## Strengths
- **Modularity:** Subsystems are well-separated and interface-driven, supporting extensibility.
- **Testability:** High test coverage and file-independent tests.
- **Event System:** Enables loose coupling and future extensibility.
- **Documentation:** Good onboarding and subsystem documentation.
- **Hot-Reloading:** Improves developer productivity.

## Areas for Improvement
- **ResourceManager:** Generalize to support more resource types (shaders, user assets); add asset hot-reloading and analytics.
- **Renderer:** Expand scene graph (hierarchical transforms, instancing); add lighting, post-processing, and a material/shader system.
- **Physics:** Integrate advanced features (rigid/soft body, collision events); expose events to ECS and scripting.
- **Plugin/Extension System:** Design for user-defined subsystems and tooling.
- **Event System:** Add event priorities, propagation, and advanced documentation.
- **Tooling:** Consider in-engine tools (script editor, inspector, debugging UI).
- **Configuration:** Centralize and support live reloading; document templates for common use cases.

## Recommendations
1. **Define and enforce interfaces** for all subsystems to ease testing, extension, and replacement.
2. **Expand the event system** with priorities and propagation; document event flows for contributors.
3. **Generalize ResourceManager** for user-defined types and hot-reloading; track resource usage.
4. **Enhance the renderer** with a material/shader API and support for advanced scene graph features.
5. **Expose physics events** and allow pluggable backends.
6. **Prototype a plugin system** for user/community extensions.
7. **Maintain and expand documentation** as architecture evolves; add diagrams and flowcharts.
8. **Automate integration/regression tests** for demo scenes and edge cases.
