### 9. Event System for Subsystem Communication
- **Rationale:** Enables decoupled, scalable communication between engine subsystems (input, ECS, etc.) and supports future extensibility (priorities, async, propagation).
- **Implications:** Subsystems interact via events, improving modularity and maintainability.

### 10. Centralized Configuration Management
- **Rationale:** Centralizes engine and game settings for easier management and extensibility.
- **Implications:** Configuration is loaded and accessed via a unified API; future options (profiles, runtime settings) are supported.

### 11. Demo Scenes and Example Projects
- **Rationale:** Demonstrates engine capabilities, validates architecture, and helps onboard new developers.
- **Implications:** Example projects and demo scenes are maintained and updated as features grow.
### 8. Input System with Abstract API (pygame backend)
- **Rationale:** Use a flexible input API with a backend implementation (initially pygame) to support keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input.
- **Implications:** Input system can be swapped for other solutions (e.g., OS hooks) in the future without changing engine code.
# Architecture Decisions
### 12. Input System Backend Initialization and Extensibility
- **Rationale:** Input system now handles backend initialization (e.g., pygame) internally, improving modularity and reducing setup errors. Backend can be swapped for future extensibility.
- **Implications:** Input system is robust, modular, and future-proof. Event emission and error handling are integrated.
This document records key architecture decisions for simplex-engine to ensure clarity, maintainability, and future extensibility.

## Decision Log

### 1. Use Python for All Subsystems
- **Rationale:** Enables rapid development, dynamic behavior, and easier debugging.
- **Implications:** Performance may be lower than C++ engines, but hardware improvements and Python optimization mitigate this.

### 2. Entity-Component-System (ECS) as Core Pattern
- **Rationale:** ECS provides modularity, scalability, and flexibility for game logic.
- **Implications:** All game objects and logic are managed via ECS.

### 3. Modular Subsystem Interfaces
- **Rationale:** Each subsystem (ECS, Renderer, Physics, Script, Resource, Audio) has a dedicated interface for easy replacement and extension.
- **Implications:** Facilitates maintainability and future feature integration.

### 4. Resource Manager for Asset Handling
- **Rationale:** Centralizes asset loading/unloading, supports multiple resource types, and improves memory management.
- **Implications:** All assets (textures, models, audio, scripts) are managed via the resource manager.

### 5. Audio System as a First-Class Subsystem
- **Rationale:** Audio is essential for games and interactive media; a dedicated interface ensures flexibility and integration.
- **Implications:** Audio features can be extended or replaced independently.

### 6. Hot-Reloading and Dynamic Scripting
- **Rationale:** Enables rapid prototyping and immediate feedback for developers.
- **Implications:** Scripts and assets can be updated without restarting the engine.

### 7. Documentation and Testing
- **Rationale:** Public APIs and architecture are documented; unit tests are required for all core interfaces.
- **Implications:** Ensures reliability and ease of onboarding for new contributors.
