# Architecture Improvements (2025)

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive architectural improvements implemented in the Simplex Engine to enhance maintainability, reliability, and proper subsystem coordination. These improvements establish a solid foundation for modern game engine design patterns while maintaining the engine's core simplicity.

## Motivation

The previous architecture had several issues:
- Improper initialization order leading to dependency conflicts
- Lack of proper error handling across subsystems
- Poor separation of concerns between engine components
- Missing lifecycle management for clean startup/shutdown
- Inefficient ECS implementation without proper component filtering

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Engine Core Refactoring (`simplex/engine.py`)

#### 1.1 Proper Initialization Order

The engine now follows a 4-phase initialization sequence:

```python
# Phase 1: Core systems (no dependencies)
self.config = Config(config_path)
self.events = EventSystem()

# Phase 2: Primary subsystems (depend on core systems)
self.ecs = ECS(event_system=self.events)
self.resource_manager = ResourceManager()

# Phase 3: Secondary subsystems (may depend on primary systems)
self.renderer = Renderer(event_system=self.events, resource_manager=self.resource_manager)
self.physics = Physics(event_system=self.events, ecs=self.ecs)
# ... other subsystems

# Phase 4: System integration and event wiring
self._initialize_subsystems()
self._setup_event_handlers()
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates circular dependencies
- Ensures all dependencies are available when needed
- Clear separation between core and application-level systems

#### 1.2 Dependency Injection Pattern

All subsystems now receive their dependencies through constructor parameters:

```python
class Renderer:
    def __init__(self, event_system=None, resource_manager=None):
        self.event_system = event_system
        self.resource_manager = resource_manager
```

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling between subsystems
- Easier testing with mock dependencies
- Clear declaration of system requirements

#### 1.3 Enhanced Error Handling

Centralized error handling with event-driven error propagation:

```python
def _handle_system_error(self, event):
    """Handle system error events."""
    if isinstance(event, dict):
        system_name = event.get('system', 'Unknown')
        error = event.get('error', 'Unknown error')
        log(f"System Error in {system_name}: {error}", level="ERROR")
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent error handling across all subsystems
- Event-driven error reporting enables monitoring and debugging
- Graceful degradation when subsystems fail

#### 1.4 Lifecycle Management

Proper lifecycle management with state tracking:

```python
class Engine:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running = False
        self._initialized = False
        # ... initialization
        self._initialized = True
    
    def update(self, delta_time: float = 0.016):
        """Frame-based update cycle"""
        
    def shutdown(self):
        """Clean shutdown of all subsystems"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear system state management
- Proper resource cleanup
- Frame-based update cycle for real-time applications

### 2. ECS System Enhancement (`simplex/ecs/ecs.py`)

#### 2.1 Enhanced Entity Management

```python
class ECS:
    def __init__(self, event_system=None):
        self.entities: List[Entity] = []
        self.systems: List[System] = []
        self._entity_lookup: Dict[str, Entity] = {}  # O(1) lookup
```

**Improvements:**
- O(1) entity lookup using `_entity_lookup` dictionary
- Proper component type tracking
- Component lifecycle management

#### 2.2 Improved System Architecture

```python
class System:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.required_components: List[str] = []
    
    def get_filtered_entities(self, entities: List[Entity]) -> List[Entity]:
        """Filter entities that have all required components."""
        if not self.required_components:
            return entities
        return [e for e in entities if e.has_components(*self.required_components)]
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic entity filtering based on required components
- Efficient processing of only relevant entities
- Clear system requirements declaration

#### 2.3 Better Error Handling

```python
def update(self) -> None:
    """Run all systems on filtered entities."""
    for system in self.systems:
        try:
            system.update(self.entities)
        except Exception as e:
            log(f"Error in system {system.name}: {e}", level="ERROR")
            if self.event_system:
                self.event_system.emit('system_error', {'system': system.name, 'error': str(e)})
```

**Benefits:**
- Individual system error isolation
- Event emission for system failures
- Continued operation despite system failures

### 3. Subsystem Modernization

#### 3.1 Renderer Improvements (`simplex/renderer/renderer.py`)

```python
class Renderer:
    def __init__(self, event_system=None, resource_manager=None):
        self.event_system = event_system
        self.resource_manager = resource_manager
        self._initialized = False
        self.backend = None
    
    def initialize(self, config=None):
        """Initialize renderer with configuration."""
        backend_type = self.config.get("backend", "debug")
        if backend_type == "pygame":
            self._initialize_pygame_backend()
        elif backend_type == "opengl":
            self._initialize_opengl_backend()
        else:
            self._initialize_debug_backend()
```

**Improvements:**
- Backend abstraction (pygame, opengl, debug)
- Proper initialization with configuration
- Dependency injection for event system and resource manager
- Clean shutdown procedures

#### 3.2 Physics System (`simplex/physics/physics.py`)

```python
class Physics:
    def __init__(self, event_system=None, ecs=None):
        self.event_system = event_system
        self.ecs = ecs  # Reference for entity-based physics
        self._initialized = False
    
    def _simulate_ecs_physics(self):
        """Apply physics to ECS entities with physics components."""
        physics_entities = self.ecs.get_entities_with('position', 'velocity')
        # ... physics simulation
```

**Improvements:**
- Backend support (PyBullet, builtin)
- Direct ECS integration for entity-based physics
- Proper component filtering
- Error handling and event emission

#### 3.3 Audio System (`simplex/audio/audio.py`)

**Improvements:**
- Backend abstraction with pygame mixer
- Event emission for audio events (`audio_play`, `audio_stop`)
- Proper initialization checks
- Clean shutdown procedures

#### 3.4 Script Manager (`simplex/script/script_manager.py`)

**Improvements:**
- Engine reference for script access to engine subsystems
- Proper error tracking and reporting
- Fixed import issues and attribute references
- Enhanced event hook system

### 4. Enhanced System Communication

#### 4.1 Event System Integration

All subsystems are now properly integrated with the event system:

```python
# Engine event handler setup
self.events.register('input', self._handle_input_event)
self.events.register('physics_collision', self._handle_physics_collision)
self.events.register('score', self._handle_score_event)
self.events.register('system_error', self._handle_system_error)
```

#### 4.2 New Event Types

- `input` - Input events from input system
- `physics_collision` - Collision detection events
- `score` - Game scoring events  
- `system_error` - System error reporting
- `audio_play`/`audio_stop` - Audio system events

### 5. Game Systems Improvements (`simplex/ecs/systems.py`)

All ECS systems have been updated to use the enhanced architecture:

```python
class MovementSystem(System):
    def __init__(self, event_system=None, bounds=(800, 600)):
        super().__init__('movement')
        self.event_system = event_system
        self.bounds_width, self.bounds_height = bounds
        self.required_components = ['position', 'velocity']
    
    def _process_entities(self, entities):
        """Update positions based on velocities for entities with both components."""
        for entity in entities:
            # ... movement logic
```

**Improvements:**
- Enhanced component filtering with `required_components`
- Automatic entity filtering based on required components
- Proper `_process_entities()` method implementation
- Better error handling and event emission

## Benefits of the New Architecture

- **Event-Driven Communication**: Loose coupling enables easy feature addition
- **Component Architecture**: ECS supports complex game objects

### 4. Performance
- **O(1) Entity Lookup**: Efficient entity management in ECS
- **Component Filtering**: Systems only process relevant entities
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 5. Developer Experience
