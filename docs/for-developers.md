# For Developers

This section contains reference material and developer guides for contributors, integrators, and engine maintainers.

Important resources:

- API Reference: ./api/complete.md — complete API for engine internals.
- Core Concepts: ./core-concepts/README.md — architecture, ECS, events, and resource management.
- Systems & Features: ./systems/ — documentation for built-in systems: rendering, physics, audio, input, scripting.
- Development: ./development/ — setup, testing, contributing guidelines.
- Advanced: ./advanced/ — performance tuning, custom systems, plugin development.

Developer quick start:
1. Clone the repo and follow the setup in ./development/setup.md
2. Run tests with pytest (see ./development/testing.md).
3. Read the core architecture docs in ./core-concepts before implementing large features.

Contributing:
- Follow the code style and testing guidelines in ./development/contributing.md
- Use the examples directory to test changes locally
