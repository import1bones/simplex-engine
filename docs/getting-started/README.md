# Getting Started with Simplex Engine

Welcome to Simplex Engine! This section will guide you through installation, setup, and creating your first game.

## What is Simplex Engine?

Simplex Engine is a modern, lightweight game engine built in Python. It features:
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture for flexible game object management
- **Event-driven** communication between systems
- **Hot-reloading** for rapid development
- **Multiple backends** for rendering, physics, and audio
- **Simple API** that's easy to learn and use

## Quick Start Path

Follow this recommended learning path:

### 1. üì¶ [Installation & Setup](./installation.md)
Get Simplex Engine installed and running on your system.

### 2. üéÆ [Your First Project](./first-project.md)
Create a simple "Hello World" project to verify everything works.

### 3. üèì [Ping Pong Tutorial](./ping-pong-tutorial.md)
Build a complete Ping Pong game step-by-step. This tutorial covers:
- Creating entities and components
- Implementing game systems
- Handling input
