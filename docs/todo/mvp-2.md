# MVP-2 (Sprint 2 / MCP+): Next Stage Task List for simplex-engine

## Sprint 2 Definition
Sprint 2 (MVP+) builds on the completed MVP and targets the most valuable next features for simplex-engine, preparing the engine for broader use cases and improved user/developer experience.

## Sorted Sprint 2 Task List

### 1. Audio System
- Implement Audio subsystem (play, stop, resource management)
- Integrate with ResourceManager for audio assets
- Add basic sound playback to demo scenes

### 2. Advanced Scripting & Hot-Reloading
- Add hot-reloading for Python scripts
- Enable dynamic updates to game logic without restarting the engine

### 3. Demo Scene Expansion & Example Projects
- Expand MVP demo in `examples/mvp/` to showcase all subsystems, including audio and advanced scripting
- Add onboarding documentation and usage examples

### 4. Resource Manager Enhancements
- Add resource caching and reference counting
- Support more resource types (e.g., shaders, advanced materials)

### 5. Renderer Improvements
- Add support for advanced primitives, materials, and effects
- Implement basic scene graph

### 6. Input System Extensibility
- Prototype a lightweight or platform-specific backend (optional, for trade-off)
- Document backend swap process and limitations

### 7. Testing & Documentation
- Write unit tests for new features and subsystems
- Update architecture, design, and decision docs
- Document configuration options and event types

### Feature Sorting (Most Valuable First)
1. Audio System (high user impact, essential for games/media)
2. Hot-reloading scripting (developer productivity, rapid iteration)
3. Demo scene expansion (onboarding, validation)
4. Resource manager enhancements (performance, scalability)
5. Renderer improvements (visual fidelity, extensibility)
6. Input system extensibility (future-proofing, platform support)
7. Testing & documentation (maintainability, onboarding)

---
Sprint 2 will further validate the architecture, improve user and developer experience, and prepare the engine for broader use cases.
