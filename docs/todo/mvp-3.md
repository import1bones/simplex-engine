# MVP-3 (Sprint 3 / Extensibility & Advanced Features): TODO List for simplex-engine

## Sprint 3 TODOs

### Physics System Expansion
- [ ] Integrate advanced physics features (rigid body, soft body, collision response)
- [ ] Expose physics events to ECS and scripting
- [ ] Add physics-based demo scene and documentation

### Advanced Resource Management
- [ ] Support additional resource types (shaders, advanced materials, user-defined assets)
- [ ] Implement resource hot-reloading for assets (textures, shaders, scripts)
- [ ] Add resource usage analytics and error reporting

### Renderer Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for lighting and basic post-processing effects
- [ ] Implement material/shader system with user extensibility
- [ ] Expand scene graph for hierarchical transforms and instancing

### Scripting & Tooling
- [ ] Integrate in-engine script editor (optional: basic UI or CLI)
- [ ] Add script debugging and error reporting
- [ ] Document advanced scripting patterns and event hooks

### Input & Event System
- [ ] Add support for gamepad and touch input
- [ ] Implement event priorities and propagation (bubbling/capturing)
- [ ] Document event system extensibility and advanced usage

### Engine Core & Flexibility
- [ ] Add configuration hot-reloading (live config changes)
- [ ] Prototype plugin system for user-defined subsystems
- [ ] Refactor for improved modularity and testability

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Expand integration and edge-case tests for all subsystems
- [ ] Update and expand onboarding, architecture, and API docs
- [ ] Provide advanced example projects and usage guides

---
Sprint 3 TODOs focus on extensibility, advanced features, and developer experience, preparing the engine for real-world projects and community contributions.

---
**Next Steps:**
- Prioritize physics and resource hot-reloading
- Expand renderer and scripting capabilities
- Continue improving modularity, documentation, and onboarding
- Gather feedback from early users and iterate on extensibility features
