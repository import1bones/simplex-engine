# MVP-5: Priority-Based Engine Integration & Value Delivery

## Goal
Deliver maximum value by completing the most impactful features that demonstrate engine capabilities, focusing on GUI rendering, engine subsystem integration, and developer experience improvements.

## Project Status Assessment
**Completed (MVP-1 to MVP-3):**
- ‚úÖ All core subsystems implemented (ECS, Physics, Input, Event, Renderer, Audio, ScriptManager, ResourceManager)
- ‚úÖ Event-driven architecture with priorities and propagation
- ‚úÖ Hot-reloading for scripts and resources
- ‚úÖ Plugin system and CLI script editor
- ‚úÖ Touch/gamepad input support in Input subsystem
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing and documentation
- ‚úÖ CLI ping-pong sample demonstrating input/event integration

**Current Gaps (MVP-4 Status):**
- ‚ùå Renderer is stub-only (logs but no actual GUI rendering)
- ‚ùå Physics/collision handled manually in CLI loop (not via event system)
- ‚ùå ECS not used for game entity management (manual position updates)

## Value-Prioritized Roadmap

### Priority 1: Core Engine Subsystem Integration (HIGH VALUE - Foundation) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Value:** Demonstrates engine architecture integrity and event-driven design
- [x] **P1.1** Refactor ping-pong to use ECS for entity management (player, AI, ball entities with position/velocity components)
- [x] **P1.2** Move physics/collision logic to Physics subsystem with event emission  
- [x] **P1.3** Implement proper ECS systems: MovementSystem, CollisionSystem, ScoringSystem
- [x] **P1.4** Use event system for all game logic flow (input ‚Üí movement ‚Üí collision ‚Üí scoring)

### Priority 2: Minimal GUI Renderer (HIGH VALUE - Visual Demo) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Value:** Transforms engine from CLI tool to visual game engine
- [x] **P2.1** Implement basic GUI renderer using pygame for 2D shapes (rectangles, circles)
- [x] **P2.2** Render paddles, ball, and background with actual graphics
- [x] **P2.3** Add score overlay and win/lose messages in GUI
- [x] **P2.4** Replace CLI simulation with GUI game loop

### Priority 3: Engine Polish & Developer Experience (MEDIUM VALUE - Usability)
**Value:** Makes engine more accessible and production-ready
- [ ] **P3.1** Add debug overlay (FPS, entity count, event log)
- [ ] **P3.2** Implement pause/resume functionality
- [ ] **P3.3** Add configuration options for game settings (paddle speed, ball speed, win condition)
- [ ] **P3.4** Create comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions

### Priority 4: Extensibility Demo (MEDIUM VALUE - Advanced Features)
**Value:** Demonstrates plugin system and extensibility
- [ ] **P4.1** Create a plugin example (e.g., power-up that speeds up ball)
- [ ] **P4.2** Show hot-reloading in GUI mode (modify plugin while game runs)
- [ ] **P4.3** Document plugin development workflow

### Priority 5: Testing & Documentation (LOW VALUE - Maintenance)
**Value:** Ensures long-term maintainability
- [ ] **P5.1** Add unit tests for ping-pong game logic
- [ ] **P5.2** Create onboarding tutorial document
- [ ] **P5.3** Add troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 (Week 1):** Engine Integration Core (P1.1-P1.4)
- Focus on making the engine architecture work properly with ECS and event-driven design
- This validates the engine's fundamental design

**Phase 2 (Week 2):** Visual MVP (P2.1-P2.4)  
- Implement minimal but functional GUI rendering
- This transforms the project from a CLI tool to a visual game engine

**Phase 3 (Week 3):** Polish & Extensions (P3.1-P4.3)
- Add developer-facing features and extensibility demos
- This makes the engine more professional and usable

**Phase 4 (Week 4):** Documentation & Testing (P5.1-P5.3)
- Complete the project with proper testing and onboarding
- This ensures long-term success and adoption

## MVP-5 Status Tracking

**Key Success Metrics:**
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** Engine subsystems properly integrated (ECS manages entities, Physics handles collisions, Events drive logic)
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** GUI renderer displays actual graphics (not just logs)  
3. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** Ping-pong sample is playable and fun in GUI mode
4. ‚è≥ Plugin system demonstrated with working example
5. ‚è≥ Developer documentation enables new users to build games

**Target:** Transform simplex-engine from a CLI proof-of-concept into a visual, extensible game engine with proper architecture and developer experience.

**Current Status:** üéâ **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED** - Core engine architecture validated with working GUI game! Priorities 1 & 2 complete.
